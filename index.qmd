Hello! My name is Emily Mitchell, and I am studying Ecosystem Science and Sustainability with a minor in Watershed Science at Colorado State University. I hope to develop a career in environmental science with a concentration in water quality and water management. I grew up in Northwest Montana and enjoy spending time outside hiking, camping, and skiing. I also enjoy baking, crafting, and rollerblading.
