In the Spring of 2025 I took a Quantitative Reasoning class based in R. Here is a collection of projects from that class.

1.  Personal Portfolio Website
    -   Linked [Here](https://emilymitchell8.github.io)

    -   Built a site with Github Pages

    -   Includes a github repo for access to all the code

    -   Gained exposure to R Studio workflows and a variety of document types such as YML, HTML, CSS, and QMD
